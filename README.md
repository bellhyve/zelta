# Zelta Replication Suite

**Zelta** is a suite of tools offering a streamlined approach to managing ZFS snapshot replication across various systems. It's built with the intention of simplifying complex ZFS functions into safe and user-friendly commands while also being the foundation for large and complex backup and failover environments. It's easy and accessible while working with most UNIX and UNIX-like base systems without additional packages, is optimized for environments with strict permission separation, and integrates well into many types of existing ZFS workflows.

Zelta can be used to safely perform workstation backups with a single command, but it has also been used to replicate millions of snapshots across hundreds of systems, feeding alerting and analytics systems.

The suite comprises three main components:

- `zelta match`: Compares two ZFS dataset trees, reporting matching snapshots or discrepancies. It's a helpful tool for replication assistance, rollback assistance, and source-backup validation.
- `zelta replicate`: A robust ZFS dataset tree replication tool with very safe defaults.
- `zelta policy`: A policy-based backup tool for managing extensive replication jobs.

There are additional functions and shortcuts:
- `zelta backup`: A synonym for `zelta replicate` that adds a snapshot before replication if needed.
- `zelta sync`: A synonym for `zelta replicate` that only replicates the latest snapshots, e.g., for faster migration.
- `zelta clone`: A synonym of `zelta replicate` that creates a read-write view of dataset tree for inspection and recovery.
- `zelta snapshot`: A simple but customizable (local or remote) snapshot tool.
- `zelta prune`: A tool to identify snapshots to prune based on snapshot size and creation dates (as opposed to snapshot names).

By "safe", we mean:
- Zelta has an option to snapshot, or snapshot conditionally, before replications.
- Zelta mounts read-only by default and resets mountpoints below the parent dataset.
- Zelta does not have a force overwrite option, but plans to provide assistance with `zfs rollback` and related operations.


# Alpha Software Notice, and a Commitment to Safety and Community Collaboration

Zelta, although a recent addition to GitHub, has been rigorously used in production for over five years. It has successfully managed the replication of millions of datasets, with a primary emphasis on safety. We're currently refining features, finalizing command names, and enhancing documentation.

We invite individuals of all technical backgrounds who want to protect both personal and organizational mission-critical data to collaborate with us. Your input is crucial in making Zelta, and ZFS at large, more accessible and user-friendly. By engaging with us, you'll not only contribute to the development of Zelta but also gain the opportunity to receive direct support and insights from our team at (Bell Tower)[https://belltower.it/].


# Release

Zelta's commands and switches should be considered somewhat in flux until its official release on February 19, 2024. For example, the default behavior for `zelta policy` just changed to mimic `zelta backup` by adding a snapshot command and including intermediate snapshots. Zelta also now mounts filesystems read-only rather than leaving them unmounted.

Zelta is free to use and will be released under the Simplified BSD License or similar.


## Goals and Methodology

ZFS's versatility is unparalleled in the open source world, but users of all experience levels wrestle with its complex command structures with non-intuitive and often destructive defaults. Zelta addresses this by providing streamlined commands and safer defaults for common backup and migration tasks.


The act of simply backing up a boot drive with the basic ZFS commands (`zfs send -R zroot@latest | zfs receive backup/zroot`) is difficult to construct and will likely result in errors and overlapping mounts. Zelta simplifies this process to:
- `zelta backup zroot backup/zroot`: Backs up the latest `zroot` snapshots to `backup/zroot`
- `zelta match zroot backup/zroot`: Confirms that the latest snapshots on the backup are identical.

Zelta is both safer and easier to use, and simplifies complex backup and migration tasks for experts. We find it to be ideal for both routine maintenance and complex tasks like fleet backup management and asynchronous clustering. Zelta **never** destroys target data, but provides tools to help delicately untangle mismatched replicas.

Zelta works with any snapshot management system or just your system scheduler. It's currently used to back up thousands of datasets in conjunction with (zfsnap)[https://github.com/zfsnap/zfsnap], however, basic snapshot and pruning features are being added to Zelta that will be sufficient for most users.


### Latest Examples

The most complete documentation and examples can be found on our (GitHub wiki)[https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/wiki/Home-&-FAQ]. We are actively adding use case examples and updating the manpage drafts to reflect Zelta's active feature development.


## Quick Start: Setup

`install.sh`,when run as root, will copy most of Zelta's scripts to `/usr/local/share/zelta/` and the `zelta` shell wrapper to `/usr/local/bin/`. See the (FAQ)[https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/wiki/Home-&-FAQ] for more information or per-user installation.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta.git
cd zelta
sudo sh ./install.sh
```

In addition to the (FAQ)[https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/wiki/Home-&-FAQ], man page drafts are also available on the (wiki)[https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/wiki/Home-&-FAQ]. Point-of-use documentation is also provided in the installed examples:
- zelta.conf[https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/blob/main/zelta.conf] for policy-based backups
- zelta.env[https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/blob/main/zelta.env] for location and behavior overrides
- `zelta help` (From the command line.)


## Quick Start: Back up your computer

In this example, we have an OS installed with a ZFS pool called `zroot`. After attaching a new blank drive to the system, we detect a new drive as `da2`. We can create a blank pool called `backups` with a command such as `zpool create backups da2`.

Run `zelta backup` and review the output below it.

```sh
zelta backup zroot backups/my_zroot_backup
source snapshot created: @2024-01-31_12.38.53
3G sent, 21/21 streams received in 10.34 seconds
```

Simply repeat this to update your backup. To learn more, see the `zelta replicate` section of this document and this (manpage draft)[https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/wiki/zelta-replicate-(man-page-draft)].


## Quick Start: Back up the universe using a policy

`zelta match` and `zelta backup` are useful for migrations and backup scripts that deal with a small number of replication jobs interactively. To deal with large numbers of backup datasets, you can use `zelta policy` perform many backups and receive a human-readable backup report or JSON detail.

Next, we'll use a policy configuration file to perform the same task as we did in the first example: backing up a local `zroot` source to `backups/my_zroot_backup`. Set up and edit **zelta.conf**.

```sh
vi /usr/local/etc/zelta/zelta.conf
```

First, let's make a configuration to test local backups. The first line below is a unique Site name of choice, representing a location or backup set. Note the two spaces before host and dataset names:

```yaml
MyLocalBackups:
  localhost:
  - zroot: backups/my_zroot_backup
```

Run `zelta policy`. It will perform the backup operation and report some details if it succeeds, or an "âŠœ" symbol if it finds nothing to replication. Now we extend our policy with options and more datasets.

On your backup servers, create a backup user and give it access to replicate to your backup target (`zfs allow -u backup receive,mount,create backups`). Note that the backup user will not be able to receive any property it doesn't have permission to. Missing some permissions doesn't prevent a successful backup of data, but if you'd like to back up a default FreeBSD system with all properties, set these additional permissions: `canmount,mountpoint,setuid,exec,atime,compression`.

On your source servers (the servers with datasets you would like to back up) also create a backup user, and grant it access to send snapshots from your source dataset (or a parent dataset above your backup source dataset), e.g., `zfs allow -u backup send,snapshot,hold pool/stuff`.

Use SSH (key-based authentication)[https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/security/#security-ssh-keygen] between your backup server and source servers. Make sure you can ssh from the machine you're running Zelta on to the others.

```yaml
BACKUP_ROOT: backups
HOST_PREFIX: 1

MySites:
  localhost:
  - zroot: backups/my_zroot_backup
  host1:
  - tank/vm/one
  - tank/vm/two
  host2:
  - tank/jail/three
  - tank/jail/four
```

And so on. Save again, and as before, run the replication process:

```sh
zelta policy
```

If we want to back up a subset of the policy, name a site, hostname, and/or dataset you'd like to back up. For example, the following will back up all hosts under "MySites", all datasets in host1, and only tank/jail/four for host2:

```sh
zelta policy MySites host1 tank/jail/four
```

 If all went well, a `zfs list` command will show that you have a backup of the five datasets listed in the configuration: `backups/my_zroot_backup`, `backups/host1/one`, `backups/host1/two`, `backups/host2/three`, and `backups/host2/four`.

See the [configuration example](https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/blob/main/zelta.conf) for more details and useful options.


## zelta match

`zelta match` is a tool used for comparing ZFS datasets. It identifies the most recent matching snapshot between two given datasets. This tool is particularly useful for determining if datasets are in sync and identifying the latest common snapshot.

```sh
zelta match [options] source_dataset target_dataset
```

## zelta replicate

`zelta replicate` (previously `zpull`) handles the actual replication of ZFS snapshots between a source and a target dataset. It uses the output of `zelta match` to determine which snapshots need to be sent and then performs the replication.

```sh
zelta replicate|backup|sync|clone [options] [initiator.host] source_dataset target_dataset
```

The basic defaults are:
- Replicate as many intermediate snapshots as possible.
- Sending using `zfs send -Lcp`: Large blocks, compression, and send as many properties as are allowed by the user.
- Delete don't replicate the `mountpoint` and mount as readonly below the parent mountpoint. (`zfs receive -x mountpoint -o readonly=on`)

The defaults can be changed by using a different `zelta` command:
- `zelta backup`: Adds a snapshot before replication if needed.
- `zelta sync`: Only replicates the latest snapshots, e.g., for faster migration.
- `zelta clone`: Creates a read-write view of dataset tree for inspection and recovery.


## zelta policy

`zelta policy` (or just `zelta`) orchestrates the replication process. The configuration file `zelta.conf` allows you to specify various parameters, including backup roots, sites, hosts, and datasets.

```yaml
BACKUP_ROOT: pool/Backups

DAL1:
  fw1.dal1:
  - fw1-boot/jail/webproxy_bti
  host00.bts:
  - ssd00/jail/app1.asi
  ...
```

In `zelta.conf`, you can organize your hosts into different Sites which can be used for multi-threaded replication. Several targeting options are provided for any backup naming hierarchy. See the [configuration example](https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/blob/main/zelta.conf).

Usage:sh
```sh
zelta [optional_site_host_or_dataset] [...]
```

If one or more arguments are provided, ```zelta``` will limit the replication process to the specified sites, hosts, or datasets. If no argument is provided, it will process according to the settings in the configuration file.


## Installation Notes

- The scripts were written on FreeBSD's built-in (Kernighan) awk.
- All updates to the main branch are additionally tested on Illumos, MacOS, and Debian GNU/Linux with the packages nawk, mawk, and gawk.
- PLEASE open an issue if Zelta is not working as expected on your system; see the FAQ for know problems and workarounds.
- Make sure ssh auth and "zfs allow" is correctly configured for all involved systems.


## Future

See Zelta's issues for active development notes. An older version of Zelta contained a configuration editor and socat/netcat support, but in practice they weren't as useful as expected. Priorities include basic snapshot and pruning tools, as well as providing assistance to untangling mountpoint/canmount/readonly dataset trees to protect from the need to clobber backups and overlapping mountpoints. (Which should never happen with Zelta! ;-) )


## Contributing

Testing and contributions to enhance these tools are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for any bugs or feature requests.


## History

Zelta evolved from a series of Bourne scripts deployed on October 7, 2019, later renamed to `zdelta`. The first production awk version of Zelta was deployed on September 1, 2021.
