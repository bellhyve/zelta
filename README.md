# Zelta Replication Suite

This suite of tools provides a streamlined approach for managing ZFS snapshot replication across various systems. It consists of three main components: ```zelta match```, ```zelta sync```, and ```zelta backup```, each designed to handle specific aspects of the snapshot replication process. ```zelta``` is intended to be run with no package requirements on backup sources and no assumptions of elevated permissions.

The goal of this project will be to keep the tools as simple as possible with intuitive defaults and few options. ```zelta backup``` works best as a cron job in conjunction with a snapshot creating and pruning utility like the excellent [zfsnap](https://github.com/zfsnap/zfsnap).


## Quick Start: Setup

```install.sh``` will copy the awk scripts to ```/usr/local/share/zelta/``` and the ```zelta``` wrapper to ```/usr/local/bin/```, and some symlinks for zelta synonyms, ```zmatch``` and ```zpull```.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta.git
cd zelta
sudo sh ./install.sh
```

## Quick Start: Back up your computer

After adding a drive and creating a pool called "opt", e.g., `zpool create opt ada0`:

```sh
zfs snapshot -r zroot@`date -j +%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S`
zelta sync zroot opt/Backups/myboot
```

zelta sync will respond with something like: ```3G sent, 14/14 streams received in 21.59 seconds```

Simply repeat the process to update. Note that ```zelta sync``` does not mount replicated filesystems by default.


## Quick Start: Back up the universe using a policy

```zelta match``` and ```zelta sync``` are useful for migrations and backup scripts that deal with a small number of replication jobs. To deal with dozens, you can use ```zelta``` (a synonym of ```zelta backup```) perform many backups and receive a human-readable backup report or JSON detail.

In the below, we'll start by doing the same as the first example, backing up a local ```zroot``` source to ```opt/Backups/myboot```.

On your backup servers, create a backup user (```pw useradd backup -m```) and give it access to replicate to your backup target (```zfs allow -u backup receive,mount,create opt/Backups```). Note that the backup user will not be able to receive any property it doesn't have permissions to. To back up a default FreeBSD 14 system, that would require: `receive,mount,create,canmount,mountpoint,setuid,exec,atime,compression`. Add a key (or create one using ```ssh-keygen```) for the backup user, and note that you will be using its public key file (usually ```/home/backup/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```).

On your source servers also create a backup user, and grant it access to send snapshots from your source volumes, e.g., ```zfs allow -u backup send,snapshot,hold tank/vm```. Add the contents of the backup servers' public keys to ```~backup/.ssh/authorized_keys``` (and set permissions if necessary).

Make sure you can ssh from the backup servers to the source servers.

Set up and edit **zelta.conf** on your backup servers.

```sh
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/zelta
vi /usr/local/etc/zelta/zelta.conf
```

First, let's make a configuration to test local backups. Note the two spaces before host and dataset names:

```yaml
MySites:
  localhost:
  - zroot: opt/Backups/myboot
```

Try out ```zelta```. It should perform the backup operation and report some details if it succeeds, or an "âŠœ" symbol if it finds nothing to replication. Now we extend our policy with options and more volumes.

```yaml
BACKUP_ROOT: opt/Backups

MySites:
  localhost:
  - zroot: opt/Backups/myboot
  host1:
  - tank/vm/one
  - tank/vm/two
  host1:
  - tank/jail/three
  - tank/jail/four
```
And so on. As before, to run the replication process, run:

```sh
zelta
```

See the [configuration example](https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/blob/main/zelta.conf) for more details.


## zelta match

```zelta match``` (or ```zmatch```) is a tool used for comparing ZFS datasets. It identifies the most recent matching snapshot between two given volumes. This tool is particularly useful for determining if datasets are in sync and identifying the latest common snapshot.

```sh
zelta match [source_volume] [target_volume]
```

## zelta sync

```zelta sync``` (or ```zpull```) handles the actual replication of ZFS snapshots between a source and a target volume. It uses the output of ```zelta match``` to determine which snapshots need to be sent and then performs the replication.

```sh
zelta sync [source_volume] [target_volume]
```

## zelta backup

```zelta backup``` (or just ```zelta```) orchestrates the replication process, coordinating between ```zelta match``` and ```zelta sync```. It reads from a configuration file to determine which datasets to replicate and where to replicate them.

The configuration file ```zelta.conf``` allows you to specify various parameters, including backup roots, sites, hosts, and datasets. Each section of the config file defines a specific aspect of the replication process.

Example Configuration (```zelta.conf```):yaml
```yaml
BACKUP_ROOT: outerspace/Backups
PREFIX: 0

DAL1:
  fw1.dal1:
  - fw1-boot/jail/webproxy_bti
  host00.bts:
  - ssd00/jail/app1.asi
  ...
```

In ```zelta.conf```, you can define different sites, each with specific hosts and datasets. Several targeting options are provided for any backup naming hierarchy. See the [configuration example](https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta/blob/main/zelta.conf).

Usage:sh
```sh
zelta [optional_site_host_or_dataset]
```

If one or more arguments are provided, ```zelta``` will limit the replication process to the specified sites, hosts, or datasets. If no argument is provided, it will process according to the settings in the configuration file.

## Installation and Requirements

- The scripts are compatible with awk using the NetBSD systime() extension (in FreeBSD base as of 2019).
- Awk is hardcoded to /usr/bin/awk.
- For zelta sync, make sure ssh auth and "zfs allow" is correctly configured for all involved systems.
- For zelta, edit /usr/local/etc/zelta/zelta.conf to match your environment and replication needs.

## Future

The previous version of the zelta suite used internally includes a zeport reporting tool and a zmove configuration editing tool, and need to be refactored before being added to this repository.
