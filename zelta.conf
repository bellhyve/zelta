# Zelta Policy Backup Configuration v1.1-beta3
#
# When "zelta policy " is called with with no options, a backup batch job is called using this
# configuration file, which contains behavior options, backup sources and targets, and other
# miscellaneous options. Note that Zelta's global defaults, such as the snapshot naming format,
# must be configured with environment variables or in zelta.env.
#
# See below for examples and details about each option with the default option below each
# "Example:" line. For more information, see the README.md and wiki here:
#
# https://github.com/bellhyve/zelta
#
# This file is not feature-complete YAML and context-dependent options are interpreted in
# order. For example, site-specific options must appear before the host definitions. Also note
# that command line options will override ALL contexts.


### Global Options

# # Set a default backup target for source volumes with no specified target. For example,
# # a source defined as "  - source/vol" will be replicated to "BACKUP_ROOT/vol".
# # Example:  BACKUP_ROOT: tank/Backups
# BACKUP_ROOT:

# # If SNAP_MODE is set to:
# #	IF_NEEDED  (Default) Snapshot the source only if necessary (new data written).
# #	ALWAYS     Always snapshot the source.
# #     SKIP       If a snapshot isn't necessary, skip replication entirely.
# #     OFF        (Or 0) Do not snapshot.
# # WARNING: This is NOT a replacement for a local snapshot policy!
# # Snapshot naming format is an eval of the environemnt variable ZELTA_SNAP_NAME. See
# # the default zelta.env for more information.
# # Example:  SNAP_MODE: SKIP
# SNAP_MODE: IF_NEEDED

# # If set to 1 or more, attempt to retry failed replications. We most commonly use a value of
# # "RETRY: 2" to recover from everyday network interruptions.
# # Example:  RETRY: 1
# RETRY: 0

# # If set to 0, skip intermediate snapshots and only replicate the latest possible snapshot. If
# # set to the default value of 1, replicate as much as possible.
# # Example:  SEND_INTR: 0
# SEND_INTR: 1

# # If on, pass the "zfs send -R" flag which downloads past snapshots recursively up to the latest
# # match. If snapshots are always made with "zfs snapshot -r", "REPLICATE: 1" in conjunction with
# # "DEPTH: 1" will be more efficient by skipping recursive listings. SEND_INTR tends to be safer.
# # Example:  REPLICATE: 1
# REPLICATE: 0

# # Restrict the "zfs list" depth to this many levels. If used without REPLICATE, Zelta will produce more
# # shallow replications, e.g., if given "DEPTH: 2" and the target has the children "one/two/three", only
# # "one/two" will be replicated.
# # Example:  DEPTH: 3
# DEPTH: 0

# # Add this many elements up to the pool name underneath BACKUP_ROOT. For example, if given
# # "ADD_DATASET_PREFIX: 99" and source volume "one/two/three", the target will be: BACKUP_ROOT/one/two/three
# # Example:  ADD_DATASET_PREFIX: 99
# ADD_DATASET_PREFIX: 0

# # Add the hostname as an element after BACKUP_ROOT, e.g., "BACKUP_ROOT/myhost/zroot". This setting
# # is recommended for configurations without unique volume names.
# # Example:  ADD_HOST_PREFIX: 1
# ADD_HOST_PREFIX: 0

# # Replicate sources to the following host via SSH rather than a local pool.
# # Example:  PUSH_TO: backup.host
# PUSH_TO:

# # By default, or if only one Site has been defined, Zelta runs one replication job at a time. If
# # JOBS is set to 2 or more and multiple Sites are defined, Zelta will replicate from that many
# # Sites at a time. In the example below with "JOBS: 2", the hosts on DEFAULT_SITE and SITE_TWO
# # will replicate simultaneously. 
# # Example:  JOBS: 2
# JOBS: 0

# # Rather than providing a simple output log, print more detailed JSON output. This is useful for
# # graphing backup history.
# # Example:  JSON: 1
# JSON: 0

# # Exclude datasets or source snapshots matching the specified exclusion pattern. See zelta-options(7)
# # for pattern syntax.
# # Example:  EXCLUDE: */swap,@temp-*
# EXCLUDE:

# # The relative target path used for rotated clones. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
# # Example:  ARCHIVE_ROOT: tank/Archives
# ARCHIVE_ROOT:


### Prune Options (Experimental)
# # These options control snapshot pruning behavior when using 'zelta prune'.
# # Days of older matches to skip before pruning.
# # Example:  KEEP_SNAP_DAYS: 30
# KEEP_SNAP_DAYS:

# # Number of old matches to skip before pruning.
# # Example:  KEEP_SNAP_NUM: 10
# KEEP_SNAP_NUM:

# # Disable range compression in prune output (output individual snapshots).
# # Example:  NO_RANGES: 1
# NO_RANGES:


### SITE, HOST, AND DATASET DEFINITIONS
#
# Note: There are no default site, host, or dataset definitions. Examples are provided below.

# # Sites are top-level elements used for multi-threading replication jobs or for organizing this 
# # file. Consider creating a Site for each physical location
#
# DEFAULT_SITE:

# # # A hostname (or IP) containing source volumes must be indended two spaces. Hosts are connected
# # # to via SSH.
#
#   host1.mynet:

# # # For each host, one or more backup source volumes must be listed. By default, the volume will
# # # be replicated to BACKUP_ROOT as described above. The volume must be indented with in YAML style
# # # with two spaces, a dash, and a space:  - source/vol/name
#
#   - pool/vm/netbsd


# # # A target can be specified for a source dataset with a colon. This overrides any element-related
# # # options above.
#
#   - pool2/jail/linux: tank/jail/linux

# # # Use a hostname of "localhost" to replicate from a local source volume.
#
#   localhost:

# # # You can also define a remote target with a [user@]host: prefix. The following could be used
# # # to send a local VM to a warm failover host:
#
#   - tank/vm/alpine: kvm@remote.example.com:pool/vm/alpine


# # # OVERRIDES

# # # You can override global options for individual Sites by adding the option and value with the same
# # # indentation as a host. The context is understood because options have a value on the same line,
# # # and hosts do not. Options must appear before host definitions.
#
# Site_One:
#   ADD_HOST_PREFIX: 1
#   BACKUP_ROOT: back/up/here/instead
#   my.host1:
#   - vol1
#   - vol2

# # # To override global and site options in the host context, an "options:" and "datasets:" sub-option
# # # can be given. Datasets must continue to be given in list form (prefixed with a "-"). Override
# # # "options:" must be provided before "datasets:".
#
# Site_Two:
#   my.host2:
#     options:
#       ADD_HOST_PREFIX: 1
#       ADD_DATASET_PREFIX: 1
#       REPLICATE: 1
#       DEPTH: 1
#     datasets:
#       - zroot/vm
#       - zroot/jail
#       - zroot/ROOT/default

# # Here's another example site definition with multiple hosts, source volumes, and targets.
#
# SITE_THREE:
#   host3.othernet:
#   - zroot: tank/Backups/host3
#   host4.othernet:
#   - pool/jail/inst1
#   - pool/jail/inst2
#   - pool/jail/inst3
#   host5.othernet:
#   - pool/vm/proxy: failover.example.com:tank/vm/proxy
