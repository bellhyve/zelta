## System Requirements

Zelta runs on any UNIX or UNIX-like system with:
- Bourne shell (`/bin/sh`)
- AWK (any POSIX-compliant implementation)
- SSH (for remote replication)

**Tested platforms:**
- FreeBSD
- Illumos (OmniOS)
- Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL)
- macOS

No package dependencies. No daemons. No configuration databases.

**Note:** ZFS is **not** required on a remote Zelta bastion (also known as an orchestrator or initiator). You can manage replication between ZFS systems from any UNIX-like host with SSH access.

## Installation Methods

### Web Installer (Recommended)

The web installer downloads a GitHub branch archive and runs the normal `install.sh` installer. No `git` required:

```sh
# Latest (may include beta features)
curl -fsSL https://zelta.space/web-install.sh | sh

# Latest release branch
curl -fsSL https://zelta.space/web-install.sh | sh -s -- --branch=release/1.2
```

### From Repository

Installing from GitHub gives you the latest features and bug fixes:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bell-tower/zelta.git
cd zelta
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer detects whether you're running as root and adjusts paths accordingly.

### FreeBSD Ports

Zelta is available in the FreeBSD Ports Collection:

```sh
pkg install zelta
```

Ports may lag the GitHub release. Use the web installer for current 1.2 features.

---

## Installation Types

The installer supports two installation modes: system-wide (root) and user-specific (non-root). Both are fully functional—the choice depends on your environment and security requirements.

### System-Wide Installation (Root)

Run the installer as root for a traditional system-wide installation:

```sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

**Default paths:**
- Binaries: `/usr/local/bin/zelta`
- AWK scripts: `/usr/local/share/zelta/`
- Configuration: `/usr/local/etc/zelta/`
- Man pages: `/usr/local/share/man/man8/` (or `/usr/share/man/man8/`)

**Files created:**
- `/usr/local/etc/zelta/zelta.env` - Environment variable defaults
- `/usr/local/etc/zelta/zelta.env.example` - Reference copy
- `/usr/local/etc/zelta/zelta.conf` - Policy configuration
- `/usr/local/etc/zelta/zelta.conf.example` - Reference copy

### User-Specific Installation (Non-Root)

Run the installer as a regular user for a personal installation:

```sh
./install.sh
```

**Default paths:**
- Binaries: `$HOME/bin/zelta`
- AWK scripts: `$HOME/.local/share/zelta/`
- Configuration: `$HOME/.config/zelta/`
- Documentation: `$HOME/.local/share/zelta/doc/`

These defaults are enough for most user installs. If you need custom locations, export any of these variables before running the installer:

```sh
export ZELTA_BIN="$HOME/bin"
export ZELTA_SHARE="$HOME/.local/share/zelta"
export ZELTA_ETC="$HOME/.config/zelta"
export ZELTA_DOC="$ZELTA_SHARE/doc"
```

**Important:** Ensure `$HOME/bin`, or whichever bin directory you choose, is in your `PATH`. The installer warns when another `zelta` appears first in `PATH`, then runs the installed `zelta version` command directly so you can verify the installation immediately.

---

## Post-Installation Setup

### Verify Installation

Check that Zelta is installed and accessible:

```sh
zelta usage
```

You should see Zelta's command reference.

### Configure SSH Access

For remote replication, set up SSH keys for passwordless authentication. See [SSH Configuration](/docs/conf/ssh/) for detailed instructions.

**Quick setup:**
```sh
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# Copy key to remote systems
ssh-copy-id backupuser@remote-host
```

### Configure ZFS Permissions

Grant non-root users the minimum permissions needed for replication. See [ZFS Allow Delegation](/docs/conf/zfs-allow/) for comprehensive examples.

**Quick setup:**
```sh
# On source systems (as root)
zfs allow -u backupuser send:raw,snapshot,hold,bookmark tank/data

# On target systems (as root)
zfs allow -u backupuser receive:append,create,mount,readonly,clone,rename,volmode,compression,recordsize tank/backups
```

---

## Multiple User Configurations

Zelta can run multiple independent configurations on the same system using different user accounts. This is useful for separating concerns, implementing defense-in-depth, and managing different workflows: conventional backups, failover, recovery, pruning, and development.

### Why Multiple Users?

Different replication workflows have different requirements:

- **Production Admin:** Service management, non-destructive recovery
- **Failover Admin:** Standby server replication & recovery
- **Snapshot Admin:** Snapshot scheduling & retention policies
- **Backup Admin:** Automated backup management, manual recovery
- **Retention Admin:** Pruning and redaction on backup systems

By using separate user accounts, you get:
- **Isolation:** Each user has independent configuration, logs, and SSH keys
- **Security:** Limit blast radius by granting minimal permissions per user
- **Flexibility:** Different schedules, different targets, different policies
- **Auditability:** Clear separation of duties for compliance

### Example: Three-User Setup

Here are three examples inspired by real-world Zelta accounts at Bell Tower:

#### User: `space` (Primary Backup)

**Purpose:** System-to-system backups, comprehensive and reliable

**Configuration:**
```sh
# In space's ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ZELTA_SHARE="$HOME/.local/share/zelta"
export ZELTA_ETC="$HOME/.config/zelta"
# 'space' uses the system-wide PATH
```

**Policy file (`~/.config/zelta/zelta.conf`):**
```yaml
SNAP_MODE: 0  # We're managing snapshots elsewhere
BACKUP_ROOT: backupserver:tank/Backups
JOBS: 2

Production:
  app-server-01:
    - sink01/www
    - sink01/database
  app-server-02:
    - sink02/www
    - sink02/cache
```

**Cron schedule:**
```cron
# Every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * /usr/local/bin/zelta policy
```

#### User: `twin` (Failover Replication)

**Purpose:** Fast bidirectional replication for high-availability failover

This setup creates a Zelta Twin: an active-passive asynchronous cluster pattern where the active, read-write dataset receives application writes. Zelta automatically snapshots it and replicates those changes to the read-only side. Both replication directions are defined in a single policy file, and Zelta determines which direction needs a backup on each run.

**The model:** Whichever side is read-write is live; the read-only side is standby. Failover is locking the primary, verifying the final backup, syncing local properties, and unlocking the secondary. No Ceph, no daemons, no shared storage. Zelta 1.2 provides `zelta failover` to automate that workflow.

See [Zelta Twin](/docs/guides/twin/) for the full guide.

**Configuration:**
```sh
# In twin's ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ZELTA_BIN="$HOME/bin"
export ZELTA_SHARE="$HOME/.local/share/zelta"
export ZELTA_ETC="$HOME/.config/zelta"
export PATH="$ZELTA_BIN:$PATH"
```

**Policy file (`~/.config/zelta/zelta.conf`):**
```yaml
SNAP_NAME: "$(date -u +twin-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M)"
SNAP_MODE: IF_NEEDED  # Only snapshot if source has written data (default)
SEND_INTR: 0  # Skip intermediate snapshots for faster replication
JOBS: 4

# Primary to Secondary replication
Failover:
  primary-db:
    - tank/postgres: secondary-db:sink/postgres
  primary-web:
    - tank/www: secondary-web:sink/www

# Secondary to Primary replication (for failback)
Failback:
  secondary-db:
    - sink/postgres: primary-db:tank/postgres
  secondary-web:
    - sink/www: primary-web:tank/www
```

**How it works:**

1. **Normal operation (primary active):**
   - Primary datasets are read-write, generating new data
   - `SNAP_MODE: IF_NEEDED` snapshots the primary automatically
   - `Failover` site replicates primary → secondary
   - `Failback` site does nothing (secondary is read-only, no written data)

2. **Failover procedure:**
    ```sh
    zelta failover primary-db:tank/postgres secondary-db:sink/postgres
    zelta failover primary-web:tank/www secondary-web:sink/www
    ```

3. **Failback operation:**
   - Secondary (now active) generates new data
   - `SNAP_MODE: IF_NEEDED` snapshots the secondary automatically
   - `Failback` site replicates secondary → primary
   - `Failover` site does nothing (primary is read-only)

4. **Return to normal:**
   - Reverse the readonly settings to restore original primary

**Caveats:**
- Don't set both sides read-write simultaneously (split-brain)
- Always verify sync before promoting a secondary
- Don't boot both VMs/systems at the same time

For lower-level maintenance, use `zelta lock`, `zelta unlock`, and `zelta propsync` directly.

**Cron schedule:**
```cron
# Every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * /home/twin/bin/zelta policy
```

#### User: `rescue` (Recovery Operations)

**Purpose:** Elevated permissions for emergency recovery and reverts

Note that in addition to disaster recovery, `zelta revert` and `zelta rotate` can also be used for powerful development workflows—rolling back to previous states, testing different configurations, or managing complex dataset histories.

**Configuration:**
```sh
# In rescue's ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export ZELTA_BIN="$HOME/bin"
export ZELTA_SHARE="$HOME/.local/share/zelta"
export ZELTA_ETC="$HOME/.config/zelta"
export PATH="$ZELTA_BIN:$PATH"
```

**ZFS permissions (broader than backup users):**
```sh
# On production systems (as root)
zfs allow -u rescue send,snapshot,hold,destroy,mount,create,clone,promote tank/production
```

**Usage:**
```sh
# Rescue user performs emergency revert
zelta revert tank/production/database

# Or recover from a backup
zelta clone backup:tank/Backups/database tank/production/database-recovery
```

**No cron schedule** - This user operates on-demand only.

### Setting Up Multiple Users

1. **Create user accounts:**
   ```sh
   # As root (FreeBSD syntax shown)
   pw useradd space -m -s /bin/sh -c "Backup User"
   pw useradd twin -m -s /bin/sh -c "Failover User"
   pw useradd rescue -m -s /bin/sh -c "Recovery User"
   ```

2. **Configure Zelta for each user:**
   ```sh
   # Install as root
    git clone https://github.com/bell-tower/zelta.git
   cd zelta
   sudo ./install.sh
   # Set ZELTA_ENV for each user
   sudo su - twin
   mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/zelta"
   # Add ZELTA_ENV="$HOME/.config/zelta" to crontab and user RC
   exit
   ```

3. **Configure SSH keys:**
   ```sh
   # As each user
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ssh-copy-id remote-host
   ```

4. **Set ZFS permissions:**
   ```sh
   # As root, grant appropriate permissions to each user
   zfs allow -u space send:raw,snapshot,hold,bookmark sink/data
   zfs allow -u space receive:append,create,mount,canmount,volmode,readonly,clone,rename,userprop,recordsize tank/backups
   zfs allow -u twin send:raw,receive:append,snapshot,hold,bookmark,create,mount,canmount,volmode,readonly,clone,rename,recordsize,compression tank/data
   zfs allow -u rescue send,snapshot,hold,destroy,mount,create,clone tank/data
   ```

5. **Create independent policy files:**
   Each user maintains their own `~/.config/zelta/zelta.conf` with different targets, schedules, and options.

---

## Environment Variables

Zelta's behavior can be customized using environment variables. Variables can be set in three places:

1. **Shell environment** - Set in your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or session
2. **`zelta.env` file** - System-wide or user-specific defaults
3. **Command-line arguments** - Override everything else

### Variable Naming Rules

**Outside of `zelta.env`:** All environment variables **must** use the `ZELTA_` prefix:
```sh
export ZELTA_SNAP_NAME='$(date -u +auto-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M)'
export ZELTA_JOBS=4
```

**Inside `zelta.env`:** The `ZELTA_` prefix is **optional** (but allowed):
```sh
# Both forms work in zelta.env
SNAP_NAME='$(date -u +auto-%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M)'
JOBS=4
```

### Special Variables

Some variables **must** be set in your shell environment because they're needed before `zelta.env` is loaded:

- `ZELTA_AWK` - Path to AWK interpreter (default: `awk`)
- `ZELTA_ENV` - Path to environment file (default: `/usr/local/etc/zelta/zelta.env`)

**Example:**
```sh
# In your ~/.bashrc
export ZELTA_AWK="/usr/bin/gawk"
export ZELTA_ENV="$HOME/.config/zelta/zelta.env"
```

### Common Environment Variables

See [Environment & Policy Files](/docs/conf/env/) for a comprehensive reference. Here are the most commonly used:

- `SNAP_NAME` - Snapshot naming pattern (supports command substitution)
- `BACKUP_ROOT` - Default target root for policy-based replication
- `JOBS` - Number of concurrent replication jobs (formerly `THREADS`, backward compatible)
- `RETRY` - Number of retry attempts for failed replications
- `SEND_INTR` - Skip intermediate snapshots (0 or 1)

## Updating Zelta

### Web Installer

Rerun the same installer command to update an existing install. The installer reports when the installed version is already current.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://zelta.space/web-install.sh | sh
```

### From Source

Pull the latest changes and reinstall:

```sh
cd zelta
git pull
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer preserves your existing `zelta.env` and `zelta.conf` files.

### FreeBSD Ports

```sh
pkg upgrade zelta
```

---

## Uninstalling Zelta

Zelta doesn't install system services or modify system files outside its installation directories. Use the uninstaller from the source tree when available:

```sh
./uninstall.sh
```

Manual removal is also straightforward:

### System-Wide Installation

```sh
# As root
rm -f /usr/local/bin/zelta
rm -rf /usr/local/share/zelta
rm -rf /usr/local/etc/zelta
rm -f /usr/local/share/man/man8/zelta*.8
```

### User-Specific Installation

```sh
# As the user
rm -f ~/bin/zelta
rm -rf ~/.local/share/zelta
rm -rf ~/.config/zelta
```

Remove the environment variable exports from your shell's startup script.

## Convenience Aliases
Zelta pre-1.0 included convenience aliases for several zelta subcommands.

Zelta supports adding these as aliases (global):

```sh
    for cmd in zeport zpush zpull zp zmatch; do
        ln -s /usr/local/bin/zelta /usr/local/bin/$cmd
    done
```
Or as shell aliases (user-specific):
```sh
    for cmd in zeport zpush zpull zp zmatch; do
        echo "alias $cmd=zelta" >> ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
    done
```

---
