.SH NAME
\f[B]zelta clone\f[R] \- Perform a recursive clone operation.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]zelta clone\f[R] [\f[B]\-d\f[R] \f[I]depth\f[R]]
[\f[I]initiator\f[R]] \f[I]source/dataset\f[R] \f[I]target/dataset\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]zelta clone\f[R] performs a recursive \f[B]zfs clone\f[R] operation
on a local or indicated host.
By default, it wil clone the most recent dataset and all of its
descendents.
The \f[I]target\f[R] dataset must not exist.
By default, the topmost dataset property \f[CR]readonly=off\f[R] will be
set.
Note that ZFS cloning will reset (inherit) mountpoints.
Clones must be created on the same pool as the source dataset.
.PP
When cloning, the \f[I]source\f[R] can be \f[B]readonly\f[R] and not
mounted, making cloning excellent for backup inspection as well as
recovery of a dataset from a specific snapshot.
If using \f[B]zelta clone\f[R] for recovery, consider using \f[B]zelta
backup \(enrotate\f[R] to replicate the cloned dataset state to its
backup replicas.
.SH OPTIONS
\f[B]Required Options\f[R] \f[B]source/dataset\f[R] : A dataset, in the
form \f[B]pool[/component][\(atsnapshot]\f[R], which will be cloned
along with all of its descendents.
If a snapshot is not given, the most recent snapshot will be used as the
clone origin.
.IP
.EX
**target/dataset**
:    A dataset, which must be on the same pool as the **source/dataset**, where the clones will be created. This dataset must not exist.
.EE
.PP
\f[B]\(ensnapshot\f[R] Snapshot before cloning.
See \f[CR]zelta.env.example\f[R] to adjust the naming scheme.
.TP
\f[B]\-n, \(endryrun\f[R]
Don\(cqt clone, but show the \f[CR]zfs clone\f[R] commands that would be
executed.
.PP
\f[B]\-q\f[R] Reduce verbosity.
.PP
\f[B]\-v\f[R] Increase verbosity.
.TP
\f[B]\-d \f[BI]depth\f[B], \(endepth \f[BI]depth\f[B]\f[R]
Limits the depth of all Zelta operations.
.SH EXAMPLES
The \f[I]target\f[R] clones can be destroyed without affecting their
source.
